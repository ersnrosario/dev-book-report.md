The video caught my interest because I never knew the real difference between HTML and CSS. He gives a good explanation in clear, simple terms. Such as comparing how each one looks "visually." I've also always been interested in seeing what the "language" was behind a website's aesthetic and its structure. 

I think that the video still has relevence, despite it being published four years ago. This is because HTML and CSS and what they are, I think, are the "core" elements of web development. So even if they change parts of it; I don't think their function as a whole is completely different from 2018. 

Geoff Blake has positive reviews from web developing bootcamps and websites, and he articulates his ideas in ways that show a firm understanding.
